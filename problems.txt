#1 In search of alternate video stream I tried droidcam. 
with droidcam i got the high quality images as my mobile camera was better than inbuilt webcam.
but problems:
	i) droidcam streamed it's output to web browser window
	and was unable to channek it to Opencv
	
	ii)installation of droidcam led to some changes and as 
	src=0 was assigned to inbuilt webcam , now it was changed
	to some other index. and this led to assertion error*.

	[*assertion error] : this error is thrown when camera can't take images
	and this empty image is given as input to the functions like cv.imshow() etc

	iii) these video I/O files are present in "/dev/" folder "/dev/videox" file takes care 
	of the video I/O at index 'x' .and somehow /dev/video0 was deleted and default webcam was shifted
	to index 1.

====>[soln]:
	changing the index 0 to 1 fixed this problem . that's it!!
	But IMP thing is knowing that index is changed to 1
	the following command gives the list of vedio I/O 
	$v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 --list-formats

Edit: YOU DON'T NEED ALL THIS.WHEN I REBOOTED MY MACHINE.AND SAW THE FILES IN /DEV/ FOLDER .
BEFORE THERE WERE video1 and video2
NOW BACK TO NORMAL video0 and video1
